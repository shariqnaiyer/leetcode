# Initial Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        d = {}
        for i in nums:
            d[i] = i + 1
        
        longest = 1
        maxi = 1

        print(d)

        # def recur(d, k, l):
        #     if d[k] not in d:
        #         return l
        #     for i in d:
        #         if d[i] in d:
        #             l += 1
        #             recur(d, d[i], l)
        #     return l
        
        # for i in d:
        #     print(recur(d, i, longest))

        for i in d:
            k = i
            p = d[i]
            while p in d:
                longest += 1
                p = d[p]
            maxi = max(maxi, longest)
            longest = 1
        
        return maxi
```

The above solution gives a TLE (time limit exceeded).

I have a feeling this is because of the while loop. I wonder if a recursion solution will perform better. 

# Solution 1

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        d = {}
        for i in nums:
            d[i] = i + 1

        longest = 1
        maxi = 1

        visited = set()

        for i in d:
            if i not in visited:
                k = i
                p = d[i]
                visited.add(i)
                while p in d:
                    visited.add(p)
                    longest += 1
                    p = d[p]

                maxi = max(maxi, longest)
                longest = 1
            
        return maxi
```

# Cleaner Version of 1

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        longest = 1
        maxi = 1

        nums = set(nums)
        visited = set()

        for i in nums:
            if i not in visited:
                p = i + 1
                visited.add(i)
                while p in nums:
                    visited.add(p)
                    longest += 1
                    p = p + 1

            maxi = max(maxi, longest)
            longest = 1
            
        return maxi
```

The above solution works in 95ms beats 22.86%. This is definitely O(n). 

# Solution 2

I have to learn a new solution, one that is actually fast. 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        maxi = 0
        nums = set(nums)

        for i in nums:
            if i - 1 not in nums:
                p = i
                while p in nums:
                    p = p + 1

                maxi = max(maxi, p - i)
            
        return maxi
```

This solutions is the fastest and is quite similar to my working solution 1.  This is O(n)

We convert a list to a set to get the O(1) lookup. 
I have to do my reading on [[Sets in Python]]
